Hi, I'm Sona 👋

Product Manager | Ex-Developer | Bridge between Tech & Business

I specialize in navigating the intersection of technology, user needs, and business goals. With a background in engineering, I excel at translating complex technical constraints into clear, reliable product roadmaps especially within enterprise and platform environments.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Recent Project: [Fitness Agent MVP](https://fitness-consistency-agent.streamlit.app)
**[View Live Demo](https://fitness-consistency-agent.streamlit.app)** | **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sonaabraham/fitness-consistency-agent)**

**Built a dual-version fitness planner demonstrating practical AI integration**
- **Product Strategy**: Created both rule based and AI enhanced versions based on user validation
- **Technical Execution**: Local Ollama integration with safety first architecture (Python, Streamlit)
- **User-Centric Design**: "Silent AI" implementation based on direct user feedback
- **Full Delivery**: From concept to deployed application with clear documentation

## 🚀 What I Bring to a Team

**Technical PM who speaks both languages:**
- ✅ **From Business Goals → Technical Requirements** : "User trust" → "Silent AI fallback architecture"
- ✅ **From Technical Constraints → Product Strategy** : Python 3.13 limitations → Simple HTTP API solution  
- ✅ **From User Feedback → Product Features** : "Too complex" → Minimalist, single button interface

**Recent Technical Project Stack:**
| **Category** | **Technologies** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Frontend** | Streamlit, Custom CSS |
| **Backend** | Python, Rule-based Engine |
| **AI/ML** | Ollama (llama3.2:3b), REST APIs |
| **Deployment** | Streamlit Cloud, GitHub |
| **Tools** | Git, VS Code, Requests Library |

## 📈 My Product Philosophy
1. **Safety First**: In fitness tech, rule-based logic protects users; AI only enhances
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start reliable, add intelligence cautiously
3. **Technical Pragmatism**: Choose simple solutions over complex frameworks when they deliver equal value *(Recent: Used direct HTTP APIs instead of CrewAI for Ollama integration)*
4. **User-Centric Technical Decisions**: Architecture choices driven by user comfort, not just technical elegance
